# Local session TempDb table support

**Role:** Principal software engineer
**Tech Stack:** C++, SQL, D365 F&O, X++

## üéØ Problem
When TempDb table is used in X++, a physical name is generated to be unique across sessions in C++, in kernel code. It using a snowflake approach, part of the TempDb table name being a Guid. Using Guid in names leads to Sql queries using those tables being mostly unique and such putting quantifiable pressure on Sql to compile these queries and bloating query store with plans for such queries. 

## üí° Solution
Design constraint: Sql spid and X++ session mapping becomes sticky only for the duration of the transaction. Hence it is only possible to support local session TempDb tables for the duration of each individual transaction. 

### Version 1
Developer-driven support. Introduce API and let developers control it. Was not chosen to implement, due to anticipated very slow, multi-year uptake process due to potential difficulty in conveying the benefits to less-technical audience.

### Version 2
- Implement a transaction/connection TempDB table manager that tracks how many tables of each x++ type we created and gave back to X++.
- Define a criteria that determines whether the table data needs to be handed over to global TempDb table in the end of transaction. Basically everything that was not disposed/returned to kernel may still be needed so needs to be move to Global scope (leveraged the sameness of the schema and used Alter Table - Switch To construct). This ensure the non-breaking nature. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Learning/Trade-offs
- Added Sql chattiness. Since now TempDb tables were not persisted after transaction was completed, next run required the same DDL volume. 
- Increased latency for small documents (i.e. 1 line invoice posting) due to added chattiness. In tests local session TempDb support did not benefit, but rather harmed workloads consisting of small documents.
- During testing discovered that creating primary key constraint on TempDb tables was taking excessive time. Analysis showed it wasn't necessary. Since unique index was sufficient and consistently faster, this is mostly what helped reach the performance parity. 

## üìà Results
Despite performance parity on common documents benchmarks, on July 2025 functionality was still not enabled, so benefits were not realized. 
The pending work included fixing a functional bug in checking table existence (in case Sql was behind on cleaning it up),
